UsbSlimCharge
-------------
IMPORTANT NOTE: As the title suggests this is for PSP Slim and is not designed for the
                old PSP and has not been tested at all on the old PSP, although we
		would not expect any adverse effects, use at your own risk on the old
		PSP.

Those of you that have tried out Sony's version of the USB charge feature are probably
a litle bit dissapointed that you are unable to charge the PSP whenever the PSP is
plugged in. Well as I got annoyed with it enough to look into what code does the
charging and it turns out that it is possible to charge the PSP without needing USB
enabled. Hence here is a plugin for 360 m33 and 371 m33 to allow you to charge the PSP
with a normal USB charger or from a PC whenever it is plugged in and the PSP is turned
on.


Installing
----------
BY USING THIS APPLICATION YOU ARE ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY THAT THE CHARGER THAT YOU
USE MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE PSP, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS LIKELY THOUGH BUT
IT IS POSSIBLE WITH CHARGERS WHICH ARE NOT WITHIN THE SPEC FOR USB

Copy seplugins/UsbSlimCharge.prx to ms0:/seplugins/ and update game.txt and vsh.txt
(there is a version in the ZIP with just this plugin in if you do not have any
already).

Go into recovery mode on the custom firmware (hard reboot and then press R-trigger
when booting), go to Plugins and enable the UsbSlimCharge plugin.


Usage
-----
Once you have done that you should be able to enjoy using the PSP and having it charge
at the same time, both in games and in the VSH.


Enjoy
